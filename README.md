# **:bar_chart: Customer Lifetime Value Prediction with R :chart_with_upwards_trend:**

In this repository, we unravel the concept of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using beta-geometric (BG) distribution to predict it with higher precision in the context of a subscription business. Dive deep into the R examples to learn the application!

## **:rocket: Quick Overview**

-   :books: **Topic**: Estimation of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using beta-geometric (BG) distribution.

-   :bulb: **Utility**: Accurate CLV predictions in a subscription business.

-   :hammer_and_wrench: **Tools**: R programming.

## **:scroll: TL;DR**

:mag: We take a closer look at:

-   The definition of CLV (or LTV) and its significance in business strategy.

-   Application of beta-geometric model for precise CLV estimations.

-   Real-time usage with R programming to bring concepts to life.

## **:bulb: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV or LTV)**

CLV or LTV represents the net profit expected from a customer throughout their lifetime. It aids in understanding customer value, guiding marketing strategies, resource allocation, and more.

## **:construction: Challenges**

Predicting CLV comes with challenges such as fluctuating churn rates, inconsistent user behavior, and changing market dynamics.

## **:mag: Shifted-Beta-Geometric Model**

A hypothetical firm's user cohort is analyzed to refine CLV predictions based on recent retention rates. We emphasize creating detailed cohorts for better churn rate understanding. For accurate customer retention and churn forecasting, we integrate the shifted-beta-geometric (sBG) model by scholars [Pete Fader and Bruce Hardie](https://faculty.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Fader_hardie_jim_07.pdf).

## **:dart: Retention Prediction**

Use historical data to predict customer retention over 7 months. With the merging of original and predicted retention data, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is computed.
